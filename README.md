# teleport

Run an AI coding agent inside a fresh [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/) sandbox,
streamed to your terminal — with credential import, automatic git pushing, a live
status bar, and detach/reconnect.

```
teleport claude
```

This creates a sandbox on the **background-agents** snapshot, clones your current
git branch, starts `claude` inside it, and attaches your terminal. Disconnect any
time and reconnect later — the agent keeps working in the cloud.

## Install

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm link        # makes `teleport` available on your PATH
```

Requires Node ≥ 20.

## Usage

```
teleport <command> [args...]   Create (or reconnect to) a sandbox and run <command>
teleport                       List open sessions and reconnect to one
teleport ls                    List open sessions (non-interactive)
teleport stop <id>             Stop a sandbox (it can be restarted on reconnect)
teleport rm <id>               Delete a sandbox
teleport push [<id>]           Push pending commits now
teleport doctor                Preflight diagnostics
teleport help                  Show help
```

### What happens on `teleport claude`

1. **Repo detection.** If you're in a git repo with an `origin` remote, teleport
   clones your **current branch** into the sandbox. If you're not, it asks for
   confirmation before creating a blank sandbox.
2. **Credential modal.** For known agents (`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`) it finds
   available credential sources — an API-key env var, the macOS keychain, or a
   local credential file — and asks which to import (or none). If both an env var
   and keychain entry exist, you get all three choices.
3. **Working branch.** teleport never commits on your base branch. It checks out a
   unique branch `teleport/<base>/<sandbox-id>`, so multiple agents off the same
   base branch never collide.
4. **Auto-push.** New commits made inside the sandbox are pushed to that branch
   automatically, via Daytona's git toolbox. **Your GitHub token is never written
   into the sandbox** — it's passed per-call from your machine.
5. **Attach.** The agent runs inside a `tmux` session in the sandbox and is
   streamed over a PTY. tmux draws the bottom **status bar** natively (sandbox id,
   agent, repo, branch, push status), so it never corrupts the agent's UI. Press
   **Ctrl-\\** at any time to open the **session menu** — a centered overlay with
   Detach (leave running), Stop (keep, restart later), Delete (destroy, with
   confirm), or Cancel. All other keys (including Esc) pass straight through to
   the agent.

### Detach & reconnect

Sandboxes auto-stop when idle. Reconnecting restarts a stopped sandbox and
relaunches the agent (which resumes from its on-disk state, e.g. `claude`'s saved
conversation). A live, still-running session reattaches to the exact process.

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DAYTONA_API_KEY` | **Required.** Your Daytona API key. |
| `TELEPORT_SNAPSHOT` | Base snapshot name. Default: `background-agents`. |
| `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub token for auto-push. If unset, `gh auth token` is used. |

> The `background-agents` snapshot must exist in your Daytona org. Override the
> name with `TELEPORT_SNAPSHOT` if yours differs.

## Credential sources by agent

| Agent | Env var | macOS keychain | Local file → sandbox |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `Claude Code-credentials` | `~/.claude/.credentials.json` |
| `codex` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | `~/.codex/auth.json` |
| `opencode` | — | — | `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` |

For subscription (keychain/file) imports, `claude` also copies `~/.claude.json`
(account + onboarding state) so the agent recognises the login instead of
re-running onboarding. API-key (env var) imports skip it.

## Development

```bash
npm run build       # compile TypeScript -> dist/
npm test            # run unit tests (node:test + tsx)
npm run typecheck   # type-check without emitting
```

### Architecture

All Daytona SDK calls go through `src/daytona.ts` and `src/sandbox-ops.ts`. The
agent runs in a tmux session in the sandbox; locally `src/session.ts` is a dumb
PTY passthrough and the status bar is rendered by tmux (config in
`src/tui/tmux.ts`). Git clone + branch + auto-push are in `src/git/`. Credential
discovery/import is in `src/auth/`. The CLI is wired in `src/cli.ts` and
`src/runner.ts`.
